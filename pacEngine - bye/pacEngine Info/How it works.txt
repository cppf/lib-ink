pacEngine is a Game Engine designed for use with just any kind of game.

To the heart of the packet engine lies a structure called packet.
It is the standard of passing data in pacEngine and all the functions which require any form of data make use of the structure.
The same structre can be passed to all functions as a pointer which greatly simplifies programming.

The packet data format is as follows:

--------------------------------------
| Size | PacketType | DataType | ... |
--------------------------------------



Packet Type
-----------

efxx xxxx xxxx xxxx llll llll llll llll

e =	0	The Packet contains the Data
	1	The Packet contains a pointer to the data

f =	0	The Packet contains Full Data
	1	The Packet contains Partial Data (The Next Packet contains more Data; Its pointer should be given)

x =	0	Reserved

l = ?	Packet type code
